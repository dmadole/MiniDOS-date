# Date

This is a from-scratch replacement date program for Elf/OS that offers the
following improvements:

* Outputs date elements with leading zeroes for the two-digit elements of the date.
* When setting the date and time, the input is validated to that invalid dates cannot be set.

The program can be used in two ways, without an argement, it will display the current or defined date. When used with an argument, it will set the date. The argument format is: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS
